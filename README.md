# Mirth

![build](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth/workflows/build/badge.svg)

**Mirth** is a new concatenative programming language.

Mirth is inspired by **Forth**, **Joy**, **Haskell**, **Idris**, **Rust**, **Lisp**, **ATS**, and monoidal category theory.

This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of Mirth. If you are interested, please support the development of Mirth on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/typeswitch)! Thank you for your time and generosity.
