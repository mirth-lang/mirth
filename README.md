# Mirth

**Mirth** is a new type-safe concatenative functional programming languague. Mirth was inspired by **Forth**, **Joy**, **Haskell**, **Idris**, **Rust**, **Lisp**, and symmetric monoidal category theory. This repo is the WIP implementation of these ideas. If you are interested, please support the development of Mirth on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mirth_lang)! Thank you for your time and generosity.

Directory structure:

- `bootstrap`: Bootstrap for compiler, i.e. a minimal Mirth interpreter.
- `src`: Source code for compiler, written in Mirth.
- `formal`: Formal models of mirth.
