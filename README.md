# Mirth

![build](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth/workflows/build/badge.svg)

**Mirth** is a new concatenative programming language.

Mirth is inspired by **Forth**, **Joy**, **Haskell**, **Idris**, **Rust**, **Lisp**, **ATS**, and monoidal category theory.

This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of Mirth. If you are interested, please support the development of Mirth on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/typeswitch)! Thank you for your time and generosity.

### Hello, world!

```mirth
||| A simple hello world program to show off the mirth language.
module(examples.hello-world)
import(prelude)
import(platform.posix)

target-c99("hello-world.c",
    "Hello, world!" str-print-ln!)
```
