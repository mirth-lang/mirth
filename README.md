# Mirth

**Mirth** is a new concatenative programming language.

Mirth is inspired by **Forth**, **Joy**, **Haskell**, **Idris**, **Rust**, **Lisp**, **ATS**, and symmetric monoidal category theory.

This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of Mirth. If you are interested, please support the development of Mirth on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/typeswitch)! Thank you for your time and generosity.

Directory structure:

## Tools

Mirth syntax highlighting for Vim is available at `tools/mirth-vim`. To install it via Pathogen, run `make install-vim`.

Mirth syntax highlighting for VS Code is available at `tools/mirth-code`. The extension is not yet published in the Marketplace, but you can install it locally. To do so, make sure `code` is in your `PATH`, then run `make install-code`.

## License

As this is an unstable work-in-progress, the current version of Mirth is not yet released. Once it is released, it will be released under an ethical source license, probably the Hippocratic License v2.0, with the possibility of dual-licensing under a different set of terms only with special written permission.
