# Mirth

![build](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth/workflows/build/badge.svg)

**Mirth** is a new concatenative programming language.

Mirth is inspired by **Forth**, **Joy**, **Haskell**, **Idris**, **Rust**, **Lisp**, **ATS**, and monoidal category theory.

This repository is a work-in-progress implementation of Mirth. If you are interested, please support the development of Mirth on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/typeswitch)! Thank you for your time and generosity.

## Tools

Mirth syntax highlighting for Vim is available at `tools/mirth-vim`. To install it via Pathogen, run `make install-vim`.

Mirth syntax highlighting for VS Code is available at `tools/mirth-code`. The extension is not yet published in the Marketplace, but you can install it locally. To do so, make sure `code` is in your `PATH`, then run `make install-code`.

## License

As this is an unstable work-in-progress, the current version of Mirth is not yet released, and *all rights are reserved*. However, you may, at your risk, check out this repo and run it. But again, this language is not ready to be used, and is subject to backward-incompatible changes.
