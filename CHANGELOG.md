## [Unreleased]

- Added a vscode extension bundle. It is not yet published
  to the marketplace. Use `make install-code` to install it
  locally. You will need to have the `code` command in your
  PATH (should be automatic on Windows and Linux, see
  [special instructions for Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)).
