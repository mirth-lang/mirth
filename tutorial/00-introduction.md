# Introduction

Welcome to the Mirth Tutorial!

This is an introduction to Mirth, a concatenative functional programming language with strong static linear types. This tutorial teaches the Mirth programming language through a series of short programs written in Mirth. The idea is to learn the language by using the language.

This tutorial assumes prior programming experience. It would be beneficial to have some prior knowledge of concatenative programming (e.g. Forth, Factor) and typed functional programming (e.g. Haskell, OCaml) but this tutorial aims to explain all of the relevant concepts in Mirth. So it's okay if you are not already super familiar with those styles of programming.

Mirth is a work-in-progress and is unstable. This tutorial is also a work-in-progress. So the information in this tutorial may become out of date, as the language continues to develop and mature. If something in this tutorial does not work on the current version of Mirth as it exists in this repository, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/mirth-lang/mirth/issues) so we can fix the tutorial. Thank you.
