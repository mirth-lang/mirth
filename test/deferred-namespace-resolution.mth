module(test.deferred-namespace-resolution)
||| When we define a word, we can specify a type or namespace for that word's definition.
||| Usually this is very straightforward, but sometimes the type is not known at the time
||| the definition is first encountered. This test verifies that the compiler can defer
||| the resolution of the definition's namespace until such time as it is needed.
