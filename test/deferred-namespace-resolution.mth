module(test.deferred-namespace-resolution)
||| When we define a word, we can specify a type (or other namespace) for that
||| word's definition. Usually this is straightforward, but sometimes the type
||| is not known at the time the definition is first encountered. This test
||| verifies that the compiler can defer the resolution of the definition's
||| namespace until such time as it is needed.

import(std.prelude)

# These definitions rely on MyTable, which isn't defined yet.
def(MyTable.test-ok, MyTable -- Int, drop 0)
alias(MyTable.my-drop, drop)

# We can use those words. Note the body is deferred as usual.
def(main, --,
    MyTable.alloc! test-ok drop
    MyTable.alloc! my-drop)

# Now we finally define MyTable.
table(MyTable)
