# CORE #
########
# Mirth Core is Mirth's main intermediate representation. Its goal
# is to temper the craziness of the elaborator, by providing a language
# that is easy to typecheck, easy to generate code for, and easy to
# embed in other domains semantically. One of the features of Core
# is that it does not have any ad-hoc polymorphism.
