module mirth.version

||| `mirth-revision` is an integer that indicates the current version of the language.
||| We can update it whenever we are working on the compiler, and then use it for
||| conditional compilation via the `max-mirth-revision` and `min-mirth-revision`
|||
||| The integer has the format YYYY_MM_DD_NNN where YYYY is the year, MM is the month,
||| DD is the date, and NNN is some number that goes up within a single day. The only
||| thing that matters is that the overall number never goes down, only up.
